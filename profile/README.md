## Edg𝕖lligence
At the forefront of edge intelligence, our research group relentlessly pursues breakthroughs. By fostering a culture of diverse perspectives, we cultivate an environment that unlocks the power of AI at the network edge, pioneering the future of intelligent, distributed computing. We explore two frontiers:
- **Empowering the Edge:** We develop AI techniques to optimize edge computing performance, enabling faster processing and smarter decision-making at the network's frontier.
- **AI at the Edge:** We unlock the potential of distributed and federated learning, allowing AI models to run efficiently on edge devices, unlocking new possibilities for secure and localized intelligence.

Shape the future of computing, one intelligent edge at a Time: join our team!
