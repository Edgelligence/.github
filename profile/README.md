At the forefront of edge intelligence, our research group relentlessly pursues breakthroughs. By fostering a culture of diverse perspectives, we cultivate an environment that unlocks the power of AI at the network edge, pioneering the future of intelligent, distributed computing. We explore two frontiers:
- **AI for the Edge:** We develop AI techniques to optimize edge computing performance, enabling faster processing and smarter decision-making at the network edge.
- **AI at the Edge:** We unlock the potential of distributed and federated learning, allowing AI models to run efficiently on edge devices, unlocking new possibilities for secure and localized intelligence.

Shape the future of next-level computing, one intelligent edge at a time: join our team!
